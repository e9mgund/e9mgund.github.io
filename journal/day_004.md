1. Today we had to solve 2 math assignments. Both were easy.
2. I solved my first linux bash assignment today. Learning new things is always exciting.
3. Today we met our new instructor Tansvi. She taught us linux and bash scripts.
4. Linux bash scripts are way much faster than any other scripting language. Because with linux we are directly writing code on upper level of kernal.
5. Python scripts are slow compared to linux scripts, reason being python is a very high level language and linux bash scripts are low level scripts.
