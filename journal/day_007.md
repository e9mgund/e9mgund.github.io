1. Python is back!!! I should also practice the bash shell. Bash shell will be used in deploying the code on cloud server.
2. Today's math assignment was also a optimization problem. Since programming and mathematics go hand in hand, mathematics cam help optimize the problems.
3. Python was very easy and also revised so many concepts. Learnt new things also.
4. Up until now, I've realized one thing that, when you are learning something you have to be very focused and patient. Practice is the only thing that'll develop the skills in you.
5. The execution and management of our training program is going very smoothly so far. I hope that it'll stay like that and they'll make an excellent engineer out of me.
