1. Today for the first and last time I was not able to complete the given task on time.
2. Revised so many Python concepts. It is true that everytime I read something about the thing that I already know, I always learn new things.
3. Today's math problem of prime factor was challenging for me because I had to learn new algorithm for it. But that's the whole point, to mold an iron ingot into a sword we have to pass it through stress.
4. My typing speed and procrasting nature are my biggest enemies need to work on that urgently.
5. Overall day was productive and important for me, because I learnt my limits today and I'm ready to break them.
