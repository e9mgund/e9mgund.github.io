1. Today I met the 2<sup>nd</sup> VP of the company Mr. Parag Sathye (sir). He seems to be the real deal about tech.
2. Today I revised the most crucial concept (at least to me) in programming the Error handling. I'm saying this is important because usually I tend not to make mistakes, but as everyone has flaws I also make error while typing in haste.
3. Today I was tasked with mixed difficulty problems. One was easy and the other one was a little bit average. The reason is permutations. Permutations have not been my strong forte. But I solved the problem using logic and common sense.
4. Today I learnt an important lesson, that was to complete the task first and experiment in your own free time.
5. When you see work as work the balancing problem arises. But when you start seeing work as your life and you start to enjoy what you do then life becomes much easier.
