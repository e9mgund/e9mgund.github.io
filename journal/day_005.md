1. Today's first math assignment was very easy because I already knew the math formulae behind it. One cannot become a good mathematician if one is a programmer, but one can become an excellent programmer if one is a good mathematician.
2. Today's Linux assignment was hard for me. Now hard meaning time consuming. Since we had to learn new things very quickly. But that is the actual purpose behind it.
3. Second math assignment was also easy but optimization part was challenging. For optimization I used an algorithm named Sieve of Eratosthenes (Weird name).
4. I also met my mentor Mr. Singh and VP Cpt. Gupta for weekly meeting. It was very beneficial for me. Because we cannot learn everything from the internet, some things come from experience only.
5. Overall first week on medium difficulty.
